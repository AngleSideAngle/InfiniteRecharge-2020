# StateEstimation

Here we have our system for state estimation.

There are the interfaces, which dictate what type of thing different algoirthims are. Then we have actual algorithims.

While at the moment our only real complate localization algorithim is EncoderLocalization.java, this system allows for more algorithims to be seemlessly integrated to our currennt system, and combined with already existing algorithims.
