# SciSensorsActuators

Everything here we have if we want to make modifications to the methods or fields of a sensor or actuator.

For instance, the PigeonIMU (default object) does not have a super east way to get Yaw, Pitch or Roll. It takes 3 lines and is really clunky. But with the SciPigeon, it's simple.

If there is a Sci version of a sensor or actuator, it should be used exclusively.
